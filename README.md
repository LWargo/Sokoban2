# Sokoban (The Haunted Temple Version)

## Purpose

This project is for Homework 3 of Game Development at Trinity University. The assignment was to implement Sokoban as it is originally or to add a creative twist. 

## Additional Changes

For my project, I found a really cool asset pack on itch.io. I was inspired by this asset pack to add a storyline to my game. In my version of Sokoban, you are trapped within a temple statue. You must push the boxes from one end of the path to another, but beware! There are graves along your path. If you venture too close to the resting place of these lost souls, they will return to the world of the living. If you cross paths with these lost souls, all your work will be undone and you will be reborn into the same level that you are on. Once you get all the boxes to the end of the path, go to the teleportation portal to escape....before it's too late....

## Further Development

If I was to continue working on this project, I would fix the remaining bug within my game. I would also want to create a really awesome end of game animation where the statue breaks apart and the person emerges. 

## Struggles

I was unable to fix the bug of the boxes and have them move smoothly. Currently, the boxes jolt while they move. I spend days on this issue, and I still wasn't able to fix it. I also ran into a LOT of repository and deployment issues. While trying to push to a new repository, I ended up transferring the folder without some of the packages I needed for it to deploy. It took a lot of work, but I eventually was able to copy all my files into a folder with the working packages.
